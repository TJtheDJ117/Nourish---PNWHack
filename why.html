        <ul class="facts">
            <li>The restaurant industry sheds $162 billion annually in food waste costs.</li>
            <li>42 million Americans are coping with food insecurity.</li>
            <li>Approximately 1/3 of the world's food production -- equivalent to around 1.3 billion metric tons -- is wasted annually. This waste includes edible food and also valuable resources like water, energy, and land.</li>
            <li>Wasted food aggravates water usage and deforestation, further causing an impact on the environment.</li>
            <li>Addressing food waste is crucial for a sustainable future, as it reduces greenhouse gas emissions and helps preserve valuable resources.</li>
            <li>Tackling food waste can contribute to mitigating climate change, conserving water, and promoting more efficient land use.</li>
